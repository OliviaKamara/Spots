**Intro/description**
Spots is the beginning of a future social media site for users to share what's important to them. It reminds me a lot of Instagram (the old instagram think 2015). This project built on my skills using flexbox, CSS, HTML and the beginning of using display: Grid features. It's built for multiple screen sizes and it was a challenge at first to understand how to implement @media queries. I will be building on this project in future sprints to make it more interactive with Javascript if I understand correctly.

Using Figma instead of a pdf document was really difficult for me so I won't be surprised if I missed some specifications for items when I get the review back. But I hope I got most things accurate.
